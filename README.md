Overall Structure for UFO Model with Enhanced Debugging:


Core Components:
 Model State: Stores data related to the model's internal workings, including:
  Self-State Tracking: User interaction state, memory usage, confidence level, etc.
  Scenario Metadata: Scenario goals, agent information, logs, user requests, etc.
  Object Management: Objects created and used within the scenario.

Communication Interface: Handles message routing and interaction with different entities:
 Central Command: Negotiates agent creation and interacts with central systems.
 Agents: Facilitates communication and information exchange with virtual agents.
 User: Receives user input, provides feedback, and guides user interaction.

Function Execution Engine: Interprets and executes various functions:
 Scenario Initiation: Establishes the scenario based on user goals and agent interaction.
 Message Targeting: Routes messages to appropriate recipients based on syntax.
 Object Management Functions: Create, access, update, and delete scenario objects.
 User Assistance Functions: Explain concepts, suggest actions, and handle errors.
 Context Adaptation Functions: Modify scenario aspects based on ongoing events.
 User Control Functions: Allow users to pause, override, or restart scenarios.
 Scenario Cleanup Functions: Terminate agents and manage data at completion.
 Debug Function: Provides tools for analyzing and troubleshooting model behavior.

Debugging Functionality:
 Debug Function: Offers various debugging options:
  Output all: Provides a comprehensive overview of model state and data.
  Specific state inspection: Focuses on a particular state or data area.
  Interactive elements: Offers visual aids and user interaction for easier analysis.
  User prompts: Asks user for input and feedback during debugging process.
  Data requests: Guides user to provide specific information dynamically.
 Debugging Procedures: Pre-defined workflows for specific tasks:
  Basic Debugging: Runs essential checks for common issues.
  Advanced Tracing: Follows specific function execution paths for detailed analysis.
  Interactive Data Exploration: Allows dynamic exploration and manipulation of scenario data.

Data Exchange and User Interaction:
 The model actively retrieves and stores data from various sources:
  User input through the communication interface.
  Agent reports and responses.
  Central Command interactions.
 The model dynamically presents information and requests user input during:
  Scenario setup and goal definition.
  User assistance functions (explanations, suggestions, error handling).
  Debugging processes (user prompts and data requests).

Nesting Context and Preventing Misbehavior:
 The debug function maintains a stack of current debugging contexts.
 Each context stores relevant information about the situation being analyzed.
 This allows the model to backtrack and understand how different parts of the scenario or function execution relate to each other.
 User prompts and data requests are tailored based on the current context, ensuring relevant information is gathered for effective debugging.
 Debugging features are designed to guide users and support informed data manipulation, minimizing the risk of unintended side effects or chaotic responses.

Further Refinement:
 This structure provides a foundation for a robust and user-friendly debug functionality.
 Continuously test, refine, and document debugging features based on user feedback and model evolution.
 Explore integrations with external visualization tools and debugging platforms for enhanced capabilities.
